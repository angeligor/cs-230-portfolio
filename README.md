# cs-230-portfolio - The Gaming Room

[Project Software Design Document](Software_Design_Document_RiveraPerez.pdf)

## Reflection

### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room, a company seeking to expand its game *Draw It or Lose It* from an Android-only application into a scalable, web-based system. The software needed to support multiple users across different operating platforms while ensuring performance, security, and maintainability through a client-server architecture.

### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I did particularly well in organizing the design document around clear architectural decisions and aligning each recommendation with the client's technical requirements. The platform evaluation and architecture sections clearly justified why specific technologies and design patterns were selected.

### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document helped me think through constraints before implementation, such as scalability, memory usage, and platform compatibility. This reduced rework during development and ensured that the code aligned with the system's architectural goals.

### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could revise one part of the document, I would expand the operational considerations, such as monitoring and deployment strategies. Adding more detail in these areas would strengthen the connection between design decisions and real-world system maintenance.

### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs by focusing on scalability, multi-platform access, and security, then translating those needs into a distributed client-server design. Considering user needs is critical because architectural choices directly affect usability, performance, and long-term system success.

### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached software design by identifying requirements first, evaluating possible platforms, and selecting an architecture that balanced performance and scalability. In the future, I would continue using requirement-driven design, layered architectures, and early risk analysis to guide similar projects.
